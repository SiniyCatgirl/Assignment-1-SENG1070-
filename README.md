# Assignment-1-SENG1070-
OVERVIEW
GENERAL COURSE OBJECTIVES ADDRESSED IN THIS ASSIGNMENT
In this assignment, you will design a C program that performs file processing operations using function
pointers for enhanced flexibility and modularity. You will also set up and use a makefile on a Windows
platform to automate the build and clean processes. This assignment will challenge you to use
advanced C programming techniques, manage file input and output securely, and create efficient,
modular code. The assignment will strengthen your skills in using function pointers, handling file
operations, and automating build processes with makefiles, crucial skills in industry-level C
programming.
    • Apply advanced C programming techniques and tools used in industry for software development.
    • Analyze and diagnose common C programming errors using effective debugging techniques.
    • Create efficient software solutions that leverage data structures, arrays, and pointers.
    • Use function pointers to create flexible and modular code.
Use of Generative AI
   You are prohibited from using generative AI tools to create part or all of the solution to this
    assignment.
   You are permitted to use generative AI tools for personal use to learn skills and gain
    knowledge related to the course content.
   If you incorporate any techniques, patterns, or code into your assignment that have not been
    directly taught in this course, you must cite the source of that information explicitly. Failure to
    do so will be considered an academic integrity violation. This is especially important for
    patterns generated by AI when producing code that is not covered in our course material.
   Please refer to the Generative AI Toolkit for Students (Home - Gen AI for Students - Library &
    Learning Services at Conestoga College).

MAIN PROGRAM
File Processing Operations (Each implemented as a separate function)
Filtering
Create a function filterLines that removes any lines containing specific keywords provided by the

user.
The function should
    • Accept a list of lines from the file and a list of keywords to filter.
    • Iterate through each line and check if it contains any of the specified keywords.
    • If a line contains a keyword, remove it from the list of lines.
    • Return the filtered list of lines.
        Example
          • User specifies the keywords: "error" and "debug".
          • Lines containing these words will be excluded from the output.Remember NO global variables
    Transforming
      Create a function transformLines that modifies each line based on a transformation rule specified
      by the user.
  The function should
    • Accept a list of lines and a transformation rule (e.g., "uppercase" or "reverse").
    • Apply the chosen rule to each line:
    • Uppercase Rule: Convert all characters in the line to uppercase.
    • Reverse Rule: Reverse the characters in each line.
    • Return the transformed list of lines.
        Example
          • If the user chooses "uppercase", the line "This is a test" becomes "THIS IS A TEST".
          • If the user chooses "reverse", the line "This is a test" becomes "tset a si sihT".
  Summarizing
    Create a function summarizeLines that calculates and displays specific statistics about the file's
    content.
  The function should
    • Accept a list of lines and a user-specified word for frequency calculation.
    • Calculate and display:
    • Total Number of Lines: The number of lines in the file.
    • Frequency of a User-Specified Word: Count how often the word appears in the entire file
    (case-insensitive).
    • Average Length of the Lines: Compute the average length of all lines, considering the number
    of characters (including spaces).
      Example
        • If the file has 5 lines, and the word "important" appears 3 times, and the average line length is
          45 characters, the output will display these statistics.
  Function Pointers
    • Use function pointers to dynamically select the operation based on user input.
    • This allows the main program to remain flexible and modular, with new operations being
      easily added in the future.
  User Interaction
    • Implement a menu system that allows the user to:
    • Load a file for processing.
    • Choose an operation (filter, transform, summarize, etc.) using function pointers.
    • Save the processed data to an output file.
    • Repeat or exit the program.
    • Ensure the user can repeatedly perform operations on different files until they choose to exit.
  Error Handling and Validation
    • Validate all user inputs, including file paths and operation selections.
    • Ensure that the program handles common file errors, such as file not found, permission
      denied, or read/write errors, gracefully.
    • Use appropriate error messages to guide the user.
  Memory Management
    • Avoid memory leaks by using debugging tools to validate your memory management.
  Makefile
    • Create a makefile that automates the build process on a Windows environment.
    • The makefile should include:
    • Compilation: Compile the source code into an executable.
    • Cleaning: Remove compiled objects and executables to reset the project.
    • Dependencies: Ensure that only changed files are recompiled.
  COMMENTING AND INDENTATION:
    • You must have a header comment similar to that found in the SET Coding Standards or the
      Course Notes. This requirement is the same as in Focused Assignment 2.
    • You must have function commentsfor all functions except main().
    • Indent bodies as previously discussed in lecture.
    • Use the SET Coding Standards (found on eConestoga) that are relevant.
    • The program must not use ‘goto’ (this requirement holdsfor all subsequent assignments).
    • All variables must be declared within functions(i.e. it must not use global variables
      (covered later in the Scope and Style lecture)) except for constants.
    • Appropriate programming style as discussed in lecture and in the course notes must be used.
    • You must only use C language features that have been covered or mentioned in the course
      up to the assignment due date in completing this assignment.
  SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS
  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
  Requirements.
    • Follow the instructions in the SET Submission Standards and the lecture on Submitting
      Assignments to submit your program. Submit both filesin one submission to the correct
      Assignment folder.
    • Once you have submitted your files, make sure that you've received the eConestoga e- mail
      confirming your submission. Do not submit that e-mail (simply keep it for your own records until
      you get your mark).
    • Make sure your makefile is functional and properly tested on a Windows system.
    • Be prepared to explain how you used function pointers and structured your makefile if asked.
  FILE NAMING REQUIREMENTS
    • main.c: Contains the main function and menu logic.
    • fileProcessing.c and fileProcessing.h: Handle file input/output operations.
    • operations.c and operations.h: Contain the filtering, transforming, and summarizing functions.
    • Makefile: Automates the build process.
